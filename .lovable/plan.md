- **Gentle, encouraging language throughout** — no pressure, no deadlines
- **Smooth transitions and subtle animations** for a calm experience

## Pages

### 🏠 Home — "Welcome Back"
- Warm, personalized greeting with a rotating daily motivational message
- Optional emotional check-in (How are you feeling? — emoji-based, no pressure)
- Quick action cards: "Write something", "Visit your dreams", "I need kindness today"
- The "kindness" button leads to a comforting affirmation page

### ✍️ Write — "Write Freely"
- Two writing modes via soft toggle: **Dreams** (future-focused) and **Thoughts** (messy, emotional, free)
- Large, distraction-free text area with auto-save to localStorage
- Sharing toggle per entry: Private (default) or Shared with partner
- No word counts, no rules, no limits

### 📖 My Dreams — "My Dreams"
- Beautiful card grid of saved dreams
- Each card shows title, mood indicator (emoji), and a private/shared label
- Soft filtering by mood or sharing status
- No ranking, no completion percentage

### 🌙 Dream Detail — "This Dream"
- Full dream text with gentle editing
- **Gentle targets** — small steps tied to the dream
- Target states: Starting · In progress · Feels good · Resting
- Per-target sharing toggle
- Resting is celebrated, not penalized

### 🎯 Targets — "Gentle Steps"
- All targets across dreams, grouped by state
- Soft encouragement text for each state ("You're resting — that's okay 💛")
- No deadlines, no overdue indicators, no failure states

### 💖 Self-Care — "Take Care"
- Visual checklist style with gentle categories:
  - 💧 Water intake
  - 🧴 Skincare routine
  - 😴 Rest & sleep
  - 🌺 Period awareness (optional, can be hidden)
- Items are soft checkboxes she can mark at her own pace
- During sensitive/low-energy times, the page shows fewer items and extra kindness messages

### 💌 Letters — "Letters to Myself"
- Write letters to her future self
- Set a date to "unlock" each letter
- Before the date: sealed envelope visual, unreadable
- After the date: letter opens with a gentle animation
- Optional sharing toggle for partner view

### 👀 Shared View — "Shared With You"
- A separate view showing only items she's marked as shared
- Read-only — no editing, no feedback, no scoring
- Displays shared dreams, targets, and letters
- Emphasis on trust and gentle support

### ⚙️ Settings — "Your Space, Your Rules"
- Sharing preferences (global toggle + per-item control)
- Self-care reminder preferences (which categories to show)
- Period tracking on/off
- 🚨 **Emergency "Hide Everything"** button — instantly hides all content behind a neutral screen
- All changes apply instantly

---

## Data Storage
- All data saved in **localStorage** (browser-only, private by default)
- No accounts, no server, no external tracking
- Shared view simulated locally (partner would view on same device or via a future backend upgrade)

---

## Emotional Guardrails
- Language is always warm and non-judgmental
- No guilt, no streaks, no "you missed a day"
- Empty states feel inviting, not empty ("Nothing here yet — and that's perfectly fine 🌿")
- Every interaction reinforces safety and self-compassion
